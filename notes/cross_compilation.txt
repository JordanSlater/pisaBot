Tutorial I follow:
https://medium.com/@tahsincankose/cross-compiling-ros-project-for-arm-263642b405ac

First step is intalling a cross compiler toolchain.
When I print the architecture of my laptop I get: amd64.
When I print the architecture of the rpi I get: arm64.

And the dep pkgs the tutorial installed were:
lib32z1-dev
gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf
And these were specific for armhf

So I did some digging and found the arm64 equivalents:
I'm going to skip the first one since I don't know that it's required.
gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu (https://packages.debian.org/stretch/gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu)
