BIG RESET

Since ubuntu involved a whole bunch of workarounds to get gpio working, I'm switching to raspberry pi os lite (legacy) 64 bit no .
The legacy is to use debian buster which means I can install ros noetic.

Yet, there were further odities...
Once you don't install on ubuntu you have to choose debian and it must be arm64 or armhf (http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)
Plus: ROS Noetic ONLY supports Buster (Debian 10). 
And I don't want the desktop version, I want the lite version.

The rpi imager program didn't have this option...

So I had to dig around for a custom image that is RaspberryPi OS arm64 buster debian:
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/raspios_lite_arm64-2021-05-28/ download the zip

But after a weekend of looking at ros 2 it seems to be the way to go. It's not very different and if I upgrade to it it will be supported longer and be more applicable to future applications.

I could move away from ros but I think I still want it. I could code everything from scratch but who has the time for it. 
Essentially what I'm trying to say is there is an alternative here which is to code pisaBot from the ground up. 
I would be using some language (let's say... Ada? or golang or C++ or carbon) and I wouldn't have easy visualization, communication, etc. 
I would have to install my own linear algebra library and learn how to use that. 

So let's go with ros. Specifically ros2.

As per the above I want a raspberry pi os so that I can use gpio easily. This means I can 
As per https://askubuntu.com/questions/445487/what-debian-version-are-the-different-ubuntu-versions-based-on
I found that ubuntu focal uses debian bullseye. 

However, I'm just getting into it now and ros 2 doesn't have a lot of support yet :(
I the installation ran into a couple road blocks that just aren't worth dealing with yet.
    On the raspberry pi I ran into: 
        jordan@pisaBot:~ $ sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
        perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
        perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
            LANGUAGE = (unset),
            LC_ALL = (unset),
            LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
            are supported and installed on your system.
        perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
        *** update-locale: Error: invalid locale settings:  LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    On my ubuntu desktop I ran into: 
        jordan@jordan-GL553VD:~$ sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop
        Reading package lists... Done
        Building dependency tree       
        Reading state information... Done
        E: Unable to locate package ros-foxy-desktop

        This is because x86 cpu architecture isn't a high teir support for ros 2 and it hasn't been developed yet.
        I don't think I can change my cpu architecture...

It's back to ros 1...

Things I did:
Install the image with the rpi imager:
    Rename host to pisaBot
    Enable ssh
    setup user and pass
    Configure wireless LAN
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
generate ssh key
Install git vim ros-noetic
sudo apt-get install -y python-smbus
sudo apt-get install -y i2c-tools
rebooted

But I can't even find good c++ support on raspberrypi os for gpio.
It looks like I'm going to have to have a python node for gpio anyway.

What I need:
pwm
i2c
interrupts
camera support

Man, raspberry pi sucks
