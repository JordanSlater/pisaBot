When working on this again for the 4GB raspberry pi 4 I found this:
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/ubuntu-core-20-adds-secure-boot-with-hardware-backed-encryption/
I didn't read all of it.
I'm going to try core this time. I think I tried server on the first raspberry pi. It was harder to setup for wifi and it interrupted the logs. 
While trying to get core working I found that it doesn't have access to apt or debian packages.
So I'm following this link:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/902905/install-applications-in-ubuntu-core
It didn't work. Sudo gives this message:
sudo: effective uid is not 0, is /usr/bin/sudo on a file system with the 'nosuid' option set or an NFS file system without root privileges?
And to solve it I have to go here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16682297/getting-message-sudo-must-be-setuid-root-but-sudo-is-already-owned-by-root/19306929#19306929
But I can't start the rpi in recovery mode. :/

I'm going to try server again but this time use the instructions below for wifi.
Hopefully I can get it working again...
I got the internet working again!


The below entry is from some time in 2021 or 2020 when I was trying to reinstall ubuntu on the burnt pi. I think I installed ubuntu server 20 now that I'm looking at it the interface.
2021-XX-XX? 
I was reading this document again and planning on reinstalling ubuntu.
And I couldn't figure out what I installed on rpi: server or core?
When I look at the rpi installer I have the option of choosing:
Ubuntu Server 21.04 (RPi 2/3/4/400)
    64-bit server OS for arm64 architectures
Ubuntu Server 20.04.3 LTS (RPi 3/4/400)
    64-bit server OS with long-term support for arm 64 architectures
Ubuntu Core 20 (RPi 3/4)
    Ubuntu Core 20 64-bit IoT OS for arm64 architecture
I'm going to trust my usage of the word core below.
I redd this: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/difference-ubuntu-desktop-ubuntu-server/


I am on 1.5 of http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu
for both rpi and ubuntu

To setup the raspberry pi:
1. I installed ubuntu 20.04 on my laptop.
2. I installed the rpi installer and wrote ubuntu core 20.04 to the sd card.
3. I booted the rpi with said sd card and connected it with ethernet. (may not be required)
4. Connecting to wifi did not work because ubuntu tries to connect using a strange protocol that is not WPA. After a long time of trying to connect I found that using the program wpa_supplicant (this is the cli program name) works.
NOTE: there may be a better way to configure the wifi. wpa_supplicant is already running. 
    In future it's better to do this on the host computer before booting the pi.
    turns out that it's being run from here: /etc/netplan/50-something.yaml
    Try here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1245253/set-multiple-wifi-access-points-in-ubuntu-20-04
    To add a network to the config, use wpa_passphrase to append to the file:
        `wpa_passphrase "Other network name" password | sudo tee -a /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`
    Then reformat the to match the above link. i.e.
        access-points:
          "SSID1":
            password: "pass1"
          "SSID2":
            password: "pass2"


Once I was setup and remoted in:
    I installed ros: (followed instructions including sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop)
        $ sudo add-apt-repository universe
        $ sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
        $ sudo add-apt-repository restricted
        To check that this worked:
        $ grep ^deb /etc/apt/sources.list
1. I cloned the root repo.
2. I cloned jshen.
3. I ran `git submodule update --init` to clone the MPU6050 submodule.
4. I redd the MPU6050 library's readme and found that I needed to install these: sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev i2c-tools libi2c0
5. I also had trouble with i2c. When I ran the code I got the following errors:
    ERR (MPU6050.cpp:MPU6050()): Failed to open /dev/i2c-1. Please check that I2C is enabled with raspi-config
    ERR (MPU6050.cpp:MPU6050()): Could not get I2C bus with h address. Please confirm that this address is correct
    I redd up on this and found that I need to install raspi-config and run sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0.

    I did the following: 
        navigate to the latest: http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/r/raspi-config/
        and wget <the url to the latest package>
        sudo dpkg -i that_package
    This was the solution! https://askubuntu.com/questions/1273700/enable-spi-and-i2c-on-ubuntu-20-04-raspberry-pi
6. There was also a dependency of rpi.GPIO which I installed by running:
    sudo pip install RPi.GPIO

    I then did a sudo apt-get upgrade


    followed: https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/install/

    I'm not sure what of the three above things did it. 

    
I think it's actually ubuntu server
