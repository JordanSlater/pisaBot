You can add the following to all git commands to do the same command for the submodules as well. 
--recurse-submodules

After cloning you can do the following to clone the submodules:
git submodule update --init

You must make a commit on the submodule before you can add it to the root repo. 
Then you can git add that submodule and it will be staged on the root repo.
