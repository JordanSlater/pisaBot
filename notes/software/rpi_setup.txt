When working on this again for the 4GB raspberry pi 4 I found this:
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/ubuntu-core-20-adds-secure-boot-with-hardware-backed-encryption/
I didn't read all of it.
I'm going to try core this time. I think I tried server on the first raspberry pi. It was harder to setup for wifi and it interrupted the logs. 
While trying to get core working I found that it doesn't have access to apt or debian packages.
So I'm following this link:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/902905/install-applications-in-ubuntu-core
It didn't work. Sudo gives this message:
sudo: effective uid is not 0, is /usr/bin/sudo on a file system with the 'nosuid' option set or an NFS file system without root privileges?
And to solve it I have to go here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16682297/getting-message-sudo-must-be-setuid-root-but-sudo-is-already-owned-by-root/19306929#19306929
But I can't start the rpi in recovery mode. :/

I'm going to try server again but this time use the instructions below for wifi.
Hopefully I can get it working again...
I got the internet working again!


The below entry is from some time in 2021 or 2020 when I was trying to reinstall ubuntu on the burnt pi. I think I installed ubuntu server 20 now that I'm looking at it the interface.
2021-XX-XX? 
I was reading this document again and planning on reinstalling ubuntu.
And I couldn't figure out what I installed on rpi: server or core?
When I look at the rpi installer I have the option of choosing:
Ubuntu Server 21.04 (RPi 2/3/4/400)
    64-bit server OS for arm64 architectures
Ubuntu Server 20.04.3 LTS (RPi 3/4/400)
    64-bit server OS with long-term support for arm 64 architectures
Ubuntu Core 20 (RPi 3/4)
    Ubuntu Core 20 64-bit IoT OS for arm64 architecture
I'm going to trust my usage of the word core below.
I redd this: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/difference-ubuntu-desktop-ubuntu-server/


I am on 1.5 of http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu
for both rpi and ubuntu

To setup the raspberry pi:
1. I installed ubuntu 20.04 on my laptop.
2. I installed the rpi installer and wrote ubuntu core 20.04 to the sd card.
3. I booted the rpi with said sd card and connected it with ethernet. 
4. Connecting to wifi did not work because ubuntu tries to connect using a strange protocol that is not WPA. After a long time of trying to connect I found that using the program wpa_supplicant (this is the cli program name) works.
5. I added a wifi config by running the following command:
wpa_passphrase "NETWORK_NAME" password | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
6. I created a very crewd script called connect_to_wifi.sh:
#!/bin/bash/sh
echo "******************"
echo "CONNECTING TO WIFI"
echo "******************"
sudo wpa_supplicant -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -i wlan0 & echo "sudo PID "$!
sleep 3
sudo dhclient wlan0
ifconfig wlan0
echo "DONE?"
7. And another very crewd script called disconnect_wifi.sh:
#!/bin/bash/sh

PROCESSES=$(ps -e | grep "wpa_supplicant")
WPA_PID=$(echo $PROCESSES | cut -d ' ' -f1)

if [ -z $WPA_PID ]
then
    echo "No PID found for wpa_supplicant. Exiting."
    return 0
fi

echo
echo "Process with wpa_supplicant in the command:"
echo $PROCESSES
echo
echo "Would you like to kill PID "$WPA_PID"? (y/n)"

read input

if [ $input = "y" ]
then
    echo "Killing PID "$WPA_PID"..."
    sudo kill $WPA_PID
    sleep 2
    echo "DONE?"
fi
8. I made the script executable (chmod +x SCRIPT_NAME)
9. I then used the following command to add the script to the reboot process
sudo crontab -eu root
10. The text I entered was:
@reboot sh /home/ubuntu/connect_to_wifi.sh
11. Then I rebooted and it automatically connects to the wifi!
