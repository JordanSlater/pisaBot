Connecting an uno with batteries:
https://forum.arduino.cc/t/how-to-connect-12v-battery-supply-to-arduino-uno/595339/2

Questions:
Does plugging in the usb while the arduino uno is conected to power present a risk?
How do I power eveything with my on board 12v battery?
Current light weight battery: 11.4V on average
I might switch to the other battery.... which is 8.4 V on average.

If I use the barrel jack I'm limited to 1A.

Whereas the power board I'm using is rated for 5A.
So maybe I should do everything throught the power board and then go to the arduino...
