To get i2c executables to work without sudo I followed this link:
https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/51375/how-to-allow-i2c-access-for-non-root-users
Then I basically attempted to add my user to an i2c group using this link:

I could not login as root so I just made the file manually with sudo and it seems to work after a reboot :)
